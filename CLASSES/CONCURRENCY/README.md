# Concurrency

These classes are referring to the concurrency features of go, which it is widely known for.

These are more advanced concepts and thus should be handled with more attention.

Please note that **concurrency and parallelism** aren't the same thing, as the former refers to running multiple tasks in **OVERLAPPING** time (start, execution and end times might differ) and the latter to running multiple tasks at the **SAME** time.
