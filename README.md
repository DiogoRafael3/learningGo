# Introduction

This is a project that I'm updating as I'm learning go, you should follow the classes sequentially in order to learn everything properly.
Note that you may need some degree of knowledge on programming languages to follow my comments properly, as I don't comment every single line.

This is from a course i'm taking at https://www.udemy.com/course/aprenda-golang-do-zero-desenvolva-uma-aplicacao-completa/

This project is split into **CLASSES** and **APPS**, the former referring to pure theoretical knowledge and the latter being the application of said knowledge.
