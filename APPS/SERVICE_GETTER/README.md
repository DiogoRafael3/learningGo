# IP and Server name Getter

This is the first app developed in the course.

This app allows you to get public IPs and server names from urls using the **net** package.

To run this application either run

*go run main.go <COMMAND_NAME> --<FLAG> <WEB_ADRESS>*

or

*./serv_get <COMMAND_NAME> --<FLAG> <WEB_ADRESS>*

after performing a *go build*.
The difference is ./serv_get skips compile time because that was done in go build.

To check out both commands, just input **./serv_get** into the cmd and they will be output in the command line.
